Essential interfaces for a MicroVAX II are:

* A FUNCT SEL/SLU Module (rear panel)
* A [front] indication of BPOK, BDCOK signals
* A HALT (RESET) pushbutton

Common interfaces are:

* A DELQA (10Mbps Ethernet) interface
* Serial (DHQ11/DHV11 etc.) RS232 ports

This project is a custom side/rear panel board, which includes:

* A direct replacement for the DELQA cab kit (70-22786-01) (dual â€“ can connect two DELQAs)
* Two DHV11 cab kits (similar to H3173-A, CK-DHV11-XX)
* Space for a FUNCT/SEL SLU Module
* An iterface for front panel external LEDs and switches

The PCB sits nicely in a 280mm/360mm water-cooling radiator space, common in specialty PC enclosures.
